# Introduction

Resonance Field Theory (RFT) models space as a **structured, dynamic medium**. Time **emerges** from dynamics; **spin** provides stabilizing feedback. Gravity is seen as a **gradient of field tension** arising from resonance patterns.

## Principles (at a glance)
- Structured space, emergent time
- Resonance â†’ tension gradient â†’ effective gravity
- Spin as feedback and stabilizer
- Coherent scale setting (space â†’ time â†’ frequency)
