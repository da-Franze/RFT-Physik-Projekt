About the Author
Franz Zollner, born 1969, is a graduate engineer in physics (Diplom-Physikingenieur) with an initial training as an automotive mechanic. He completed his studies at the University of Paderborn and worked in:

🦿 Prosthetics (leg prosthetics)

💳 Smart card development

🔬 Semiconductor backend (Infineon Technologies)

The Resonance Field Theory (RFT) is the result of years of independent research, driven by a deep interest in:

Space structure and emergent phenomena
Fundamental physics beyond the Standard Model
A holistic view of physical relationships
The role of resonance in nature


🤖 Contributing AI Systems
This project was developed in transparent collaboration with several AI systems.
Significant contributions came from:

ChatGPT (Version 4o, OpenAI) - Mathematical formalization & simulations
Gemini 2.5 (Google DeepMind) - Theoretical validation & discussions
Claude (Anthropic) - Documentation & structuring
DeepSeek (Hangzhou DeepSeek Artificial Intelligence Basic Technology Research Co., Ltd.) - Mathematical formalization & Theoretical validation
Mistral (Mistral AI SAS) - Discussions

However, the theoretical foundations, hypotheses, and core ideas originate entirely from the author. The AI systems served as tools for formalizing, validating, and presenting the theory.
