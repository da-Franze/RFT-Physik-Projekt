# Resonance Field Theory (RFT) - Physics Project

> **A fundamental theory redefining space, time, matter, and energy through the principles of resonance and emergent structure.**

## 🌟 Project Overview

The Resonance Field Theory (RFT) represents a paradigm shift in theoretical physics, proposing that reality emerges from a dynamic, resonant field structure rather than fundamental particles or forces in spacetime.

### Core Principles

- **Space as Active Participant**: Space is not an empty container but a dynamic resonance field structure
- **Emergent Reality**: Particles, forces, and physical laws emerge from resonance patterns
- **Unified Framework**: Quantum phenomena and cosmology find natural integration
- **Testable Predictions**: The theory provides specific experimental signatures

## 🎯 Current Status

**German Version**: 100% complete  
**English Version**: In progress (Foundation documents available)

## 🔬 Key Concepts

### Resonance Field Structure
The fundamental entity replacing traditional spacetime - a dynamic, resonant structure from which all physical phenomena emerge.

### Tensional Coupling
Local deformations in the resonance structure that give rise to mass and gravitational effects.

### Resonance Structure Modes
Stable vibration patterns within the field structure that manifest as fundamental particles.
